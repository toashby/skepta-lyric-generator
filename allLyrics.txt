Man's never been in Marquee when it's shutdown eh? Trusss me daddi
(Man's never been in)

When it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

Yeah, take time
If a man wanna try me, no time
Usain Bolt when I run up on stage
I pick up the mic and it's reload time
Don't know your songs but they know mine
That's why I got gigs just like Joe Grind
After the show I be rolling mine
Don't care bout the no smoking sign
They try to steal my vision
This ain't a culture, it's my religion
God knows I don't wanna go prison
But if a man wanna try me, trust me, listen
Me and my Gs ain't scared of police
We don't listen to no politician
Everybody on the same mission
We don't care about your -isms and schisms

Cause it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

You wanna act like a G for the camera
You say you're Muslim, you say you're Rasta
Say you don't eat pork, don't eat pussy
Liar, you're just a actor
Blud, you're not on your deen
And if Selassie saw you he would say
"Blud take off the red gold and green"
Them man are soft just like ice cream
Seen? Start moving correctly
If you don't wanna upset me, you get me?
You tryna show me your Fendi
I told you before, this shit don't impress me
I bet I make you respect me
When you see the mandem are selling out Wembley
Roll deep in a blacked out Bentley
Pull up outside like "wah gwan sexy"

Yeah, and it's shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

A bunch of young men all dressed in black dancing extremely aggressively on stage, it made me feel so intimidated and it's just not what I expect to see on prime time TV

I'm in a different class
When I get through I'mma bring my dargs
2 by 2, man a walk on the ark
Sittin' at the front, just like Rosa Parks
Trust me, you don't wanna see me get dark
Upset cause man are way up right now
And the shit happened all so fast
I was in Paris, shut down l'Arc
New York, shut down Central Park
Talk about London, yo Frisco where shall I start?
Walked in, spat ten 16 bars
And each and every one of them came from the heart
None of my lyrics are stolen
"Go on then, go on then", that's my slogan
Wanna know how I did it with no label
No A-list songs, and I told them

Blud, I just shutdown
That's not me and it's shutdown
Ring ring pussy, it's shutdown
Fashion week and it's shutdown
Went to the show sitting in the front row
In the black tracksuit and it's shutdown
Touch the road and it's shutdown
Boy Better Know when it's shutdown

Link up Daddy
All right
Yo tomorrow I'm gonna come scoop you, we'll go to Biz's
Yeah for sure
All right
Dun know

You see the four best crews in the game I'm in them
If you don't like me do something then
10 minute screw faces I ain't in them
I want paper; divi divi wages I ain't in them
My crew put five Â£20 notes in a roulette machine and spin them
Anybody get rude I'll clench my fist and chin them
Forget a mash, Forget a clash, they're trash; I'll bin them
I don't wanna lyrical swing, I will physically swing them
That's why I haven't clashed anybody since "long son den some win seng"
If I hear man say my name I'll ring them
If I hear any skeng talk on my 3310 I'll find out where they are and link them
Headlock power-drive and pin them

I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see

More, more, more money more paper more, more money more paper
I wanna see more dough then a baker
Run tings like Ninjaman and Cartelli in jamaica, promoters pay me nuff paper
You know me man, the only man who could ever give me a bill is a waiter
Skepta heavy, heavy like pacer, I like the way things are going now
I gotta start collecting the dough in
I used to only get bookings in the UK now
Me and my crews boarding the 747 Boeing
I gotta get that dollar get that euro get that yen
Come back to England fit that again
I repeat fit that again!

I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see

I work hard everyday, I won't stop grime until everything's kosher
Until I got the house on the hill that looks like the one on the holiday brochure
I want power but it can't be solar, I've always wanted to be a high roller
When I was young I had to get Nike I couldn't get Gola
I had name brands when I was on my stroller
I'm a big man now so I want a bow tie and a bowler
Forget Ps like Diddy, I wanna make Ps just like Coca-Cola
For the big house in Angola, and the big Range Rover
And the P's legit so it don't really matter if police wanna come an try pull man over

I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see
I spy with my little eye
Something beginning with a capital P
Pu, Pu, Paper, that's what I see
Paper, Paper, that's what I see

Whatchu you mean, whatchu you mean?
Yeah, Skepta
One line flows yeah I got some of those
You get me JME? Easy
Nah!

Nah, that's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear Gucci
Put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

It's the return of the mack
I'm still alive just like 2Pac
Girls in the front row, girls in the back
Spit one lyric everybody's like brap
Flashback to the cold nights in the trap
Now I'm in a new whip counting the big stack
Yellow-gold chains and the diamonds are black
Jack me? Nah you don't wanna do that
Anytime you see me wearing a glove
Boy Better Know I ain't coming to fight like Jet Li
Spray this till the clip is empty
I know you get what I'm saying, you get me?
Love for the Gs in the ends
But we don't love no girls in the ends
Last time I fell in love with a sket
But trust me, I will never do that again

Nah, that's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear LV
Put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

See me, I come from the roads
Pricks wanna try and put Skepta on hold
But no, badboy I've been one of those
Wake up call, you will get one of those
One to the eyeball, one to the nose
I don't really care about your postcode
Take your girl, no dinner no rose
Two minutes in my bedroom, no clothes
Girls everywhere, girls in the club
Looking at me, tryna make a black man blush
Girls on the high street, girls on the bus
But these niggas wanna hang around us, that's sus
I don't wanna see a Stone Island, cuz
Man talk shit, I just smile and flush
I'm looking for a girl with an X factor
But I don't judge like Simon does

From day one I said I was serious
Then "Serious" hit the jackpot
People ask what music I make
Turn the volume up, cause that's what
I don't wear no bait designer brands
I spit deep bars in my black top
You'll never see me smoking a cigarette
Cah cigarette smoker that's not me
Nah, that's not me
Nah, that's not
When I'm on the mic in a rave
I got the whole crowd bubbling like a crack pot
See me and Skepta in a video, with a nostalgic backdrop
There'll never be a day when I don't make music
'Cause silent? Nah that's not me

Nah, that's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear Gucci
I put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me

Nah, that's not me
Act like a wasteman? That's not me
Sex any girl? Nah that's not me
Lips any girl? Nah that's not me
Yeah, I used to wear Gucci
I put it all in the bin cause that's not me
True, I used to look like you
But dressing like a mess? Nah, that's not me
